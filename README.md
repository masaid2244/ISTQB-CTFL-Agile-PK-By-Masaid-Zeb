## 📚 Pro Tips for ISTQB® Success – Detailed Study Guide

### 📖 Study Mode:

- 📘 **Read Official Course Material Thoroughly:**  
  The most effective way to prepare is by focusing on the official syllabus and study materials. Read through the material 2-3 times to fully absorb all key concepts and details. This helps reinforce your understanding and ensures you're familiar with all the topics covered in the exam.
